# Open Science Study Guesser

An emerging project aimed at creating an interactive website where users can engage with scientific studies by guessing their focus using only an image generated from the context of the study. After the guess, a brief summary will be shown along with a link to the original source.

## Project Scope

- **Interactive Learning:** Develop a user-friendly interface where users can guess the topic of scientific studies based on the provided images
- **Educational Summaries:** Provide concise and informative summaries of each study after the user makes a guess.
- **Open Science Promotion:** Link users directly to original research sources, promoting accessibility and awareness of open science.

## Future Goals
- **Automation:** Implement a Python-based generation pipeline that connects to the OpenAPI for automated content creation.
